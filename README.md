Pandas Tool is a tool that enables you to do all your data manipulation using full-fledged SQL (using SQLite3) where you have full access to the relational model, where everything is logical and makes sense, and you're not spending hours of your time Googling nonsensical error messages -- and only when you've finished all your data manuiplation, do you pull your out results as a Pandas dataframe, to hand off to plotting software or statistics software or whatever requires a Pandas dataframe as input!
